/**
 * Class: Spikeball
 *
 * Parent: [Enemy](enemy.html)
 * {: .superclass}
 *
 * Be careful when using _Spikeballs_. They are invincible in normal
 * gameplay and typically used in levels not intended for beginners to
 * make reaching specific platforms difficult or prevent the player from
 * staying at a place for too long. Although it _is_ possible to defy them
 * using the star powerup, this should really be the exception. They gain
 * their character by their invicibility, and combining them with stars too
 * often makes them lose their point. Instead, if you want to block a passage
 * in a way Maryo can’t get through without a star, use eatos (and probably remove
 * their ice weakness using scripting).
